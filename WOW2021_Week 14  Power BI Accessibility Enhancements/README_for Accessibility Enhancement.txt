This is a Work-out Wednesday Week 14 challenge, i aim to improve on an existing report by considering the fact that our end users
may not consume information like i do. Some people have color vision deficiency, making it difficult to distinguish certain colors.
Others may have low or blurry vision. Some people may use a keyboard instead of a mouse, and others navigate using eye tracking software. 
While it may be obvious that we should design Power BI reports for visual accessibility, we should also be aware of cognitive accessibility and motor accessibility.

Also, According to COQUAL, about 30% of white collar employees in the United States has a disability. 62% of those employees with a disability have the invisible kind, so it isnâ€™t obvious to others just by looking at them.
and they might not tell you about their disability or request accommodations because at least a third of employees with a disability have experienced discrimination
or bias in their current workplace.
