This is a Work-out Wednesday Week 9 challenge that aimed  to detect and forecast anomalies going on now and in the future in the Great Lakes Ice Coverage.
For this challenge i use the anomalies detection features in PowerBI to achieve this and i was also able to determine the day with the maximum Ice Coverage and 
the Lowest
