This is a Work-out Wednesday Week 10 challenge, i aimed to turn a Ribbon Chart into a Bump Chart. 
They are a lot similar but there is that different between them, i visualise the sales change and i ranked them by country. 

Link to this dataset can be find: i use the Use the Financials sample dataset available in Power BI Desktop from October 2020 onward.
